# Calculator_App

This is a simply calculator app I developed. It was a great method of increasing my knowledge in Android Studio

What I leaned:  
Setting an icon for the app  
Using linear layout  
Corner cases  
How important planning is prior to coding  
Animations   
Comfortable creating my own classes and functions   
Debugging   

There were many corner cases; here are some:   

Clicking equals multiple times  
Operating on the number that was just calculated  
Converting to int and back to avoid the x.0 on the screen  
Delete button on empty string   
Being able to type in the randomly  
Mutiple clicks on the operators  

Issues I could not fix:  

I could not get the layout to go to the edges of the screen - leaving a blank space on the right side
